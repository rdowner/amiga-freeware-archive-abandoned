  title: Fred Fish Amiga Library Disks
  description: |
    Created by prominent Amiga community member Fred Fish, his "Amiga Library Disk" collection is generally known
    eponymously as the "Fish disks". They are mostly compromised of applications and utilities, but the occasional game
    has been known to feature. The Fish disks started early in the popular life of the Amiga, and were initially spread
    by hand between local Amiga user groups.

    This library contains the 1,000 Fish disks; at this point, CD-ROM drives were becoming popular so Fred continued
    his series by CD-ROM. Those later CD-ROM collections I hope to add later as an additional library.

    Probably the best known PD library - at least in the UK - was 17 Bit Software. Whereas the Fish disks are mostly
    based around applications and utilities, in the 17 Bit library we find a large amount of games, demos, music and
    art.
