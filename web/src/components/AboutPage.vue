            The Amiga Freeware Archive aims to collect, catalog, and make available for search and download,<br/>
            the content of PD Libraries for classic Amiga computers.

        <h2>A brief history of the Amiga computer</h2>
        <p>
            The Amiga series of home computers was launched in 1985 with the Amiga 1000, a revolutionary desktop
            computer which was fully 16-bit and featured a modern graphics-and-mouse based user interface with a
            multi-tasking operating system, and advanced (for the time) graphics and sound. Nothing like it had ever
            been seen before at that price point ($1,295). It was followed in 1987 by the Amiga 500, an all-in-one
            computer at a lower cost that bought the computer into the homes of millions throughout the late 80s and
            earlier 90s. However Commodore mismanagement brought the company to liquidation in 1994. Amiga technology
            continued for a period after under new owners, but by that time the computer industry had moved on and
            standardised on Microsoft Windows, and the commercial life of Amiga came to an end during the 1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was, however, survived by a strong hobbyist scene. Cloanto's Amiga Forever product allowed
            legally-licensed emulation using the original Amiga ROMs and disks, Toni Willen has developed the WinUAE
            emulation software to cover a huge range of Amiga and third-party hardware accurately, and software
            developers have continued to write software that runs on the original and emulated hardware. With the retro
            computing scene developing throughout the 2000s and 2010s, the Amiga was kept alive. Thanks to the dropping
            prices of custom hardware development and the advent of crowdfunding, there is even new Amiga hardware being
            produced by the surviving Amiga community.
        </p>

        <h2>PD Libraries</h2>
        <p>
            During the Amiga's peak either side of 1990, the Internet was rarely available to home users. Instead, other
            distribution channels for software appeared. There was obviously the commercial Amiga software which could
            be brought in high street stores and by mail order. But there was also the PD Library - typically small
            businesses or even individuals, who kept a "library" of disks that they would duplicate onto disk and send
            out mail order for a small charge. Some of these became very big, such as 17 Bit Software, who created their
            own disk library, and curated a community through their memberships and update disks. The other notable PD
            Library was the "Amiga Library Disk" series curated by Fred Fish - commonly known as the Fish disks - which
            were initially distributed by hand at Amiga user group meetings, but which were picked up and distributed by
            the mail order PD libraries too.
        </p>
        <p>
            PD stands for "public domain", but strictly speaking this was not accurate. In legal terms, "public domain"
            refers to a work that is no longer covered by copyright (or the copyright holder has rescinded the
            copyright and dedicated the work to the public domain). However most of the material in PD libraries was
            copyrighted but intended to be freely-distributed. Some works were <em>Shareware</em>, where you were
            allowed to use the software but if you used beyond an initial period, you were expected to send money to the
            author. There were also some variations such as beerware or postcardware! You could also find demo versions
            of commercial software in PD library collections, too.
        </p>

        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the decades since the Amiga has faded, obviously the original companies operating the PD
            libraries have disappeared. Some of the largest collections have survived and are still ubiquitous - for
            example, it doesn't take much searching on the Internet to find a CD-ROM containing disk images of the
            17 Bit Software library. However these collections are not the easiest to use - sometimes the CD-ROM images
            can be read on a modern computer, but sometimes they expect to be run on an actual Amiga. Sometimes it
            requires knowledge of the Amiga operating system to extract and use images, which you may have forgotten
            about in the 20 years since you last used an Amiga! And it can be a significant challenge to move software
            between your current PC, an emulated Amiga, and a real Amiga.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is:
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
            <li>To collect and rebuild as many of the original Amiga PD Library collections as possible;</li>
            <li>To free downloads, in convenient and accessible formats, of the collected software; and</li>
            <li>To catalog the collections for browsing and searching</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">Is it really free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this service is offered free of charge for all who do not abuse it.</p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">Can I download as much as I like?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you still in compliance with <router-link to="/about/acceptable-use-policy">the Acceptable
        Use Policy</router-link>. Basically, as long as you are using this website by hand, and are not attempting to
        scrape or automatically download amounts of content, you can download as much as you like.</p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">Can I download the full archive?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but only if you use the <router-link to="/about/bulk-downloads">bulk download interface</router-link>.
        Using a scraper or automatic tool directly on the website is not permitted as it costs us too much, but by
        using the bulk download interface you can efficiently obtain the entire website without a cost burden on the
        site operators.</p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">How is does site differ from Aminet?</h3>
        <p>Aminet is an amazing resource and contains a huge amount of Amiga software, but it only took off once
        Internet access was starting to become cost-effective. Consequently it tends to focus on software that was
        written in the latter half of the Amiga's commercial life. By contrast, this site is attempting to obtain PD
        software from much earlier in the Amiga's history. Furthermore, Aminet continues to accept new submissions and
        has done for several decades, whereas this site is more of a historical archive. We see the two as complementary
        - Aminet is constantly growing with new software, whereas this site is attempting to be a historical
        archive.</p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">Do you accept submissions?</h3>
        <p>
            We do not accept submissions of individual software packages - for that purpose, please consider Aminet.
            However if you have PD library content that we do not currently carry (such as an archive of a lesser-known
            collection), we may be very interested in evaluating it to be cataloged and added to the site!
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">What should I do if I find a mistake or a problem?</h3>
        <p>
            Please contact us so that we can investigate. As a historical archive it's important for us to archive the
            broken items as well as the working ones - however it's important that the archive is usable and we
            sometimes have the option of repairing and "remastering" items in the archive and offering them for download
            along the original items.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please remember that, particularly in the early days of the Amiga, not all software was reliable or
            compatible with a wide range of machines - for example, some older software will crash on newer machines, or
            vice versa. If you are having trouble getting a particular software package to run, please read its
            requirements carefully and see if you can modify your Amiga environment to make it more compatible.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-secondary">Who is behind this website?</h3>
        <p>
            The Amiga Freeware Archive was created by Richard Downer. Richard discovered by Amiga computer aged 11 in
            1989. Already familiar with the Commodore 8-bit computers, the Amiga was a revelation and Richard set to
            learning as much about it as possible. It kickstarted Richard's career in technology where he still works
            today.
